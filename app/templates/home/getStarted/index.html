                <p>By using Leet2Git, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions. This document is meant to provide
                    a legal basis for the use of this software and should be read carefully before proceeding. If at any
                    point you disagree with these terms, you should immediately cease using the software. Continued use
                    of the software indicates your acceptance of the terms outlined below.</p>

                <p>This application is in no way affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with LeetCode, GitHub, or
                    any of their parent or subsidiary companies. It is provided independently as an open-source tool for
                    personal use. Any resemblance to existing platforms is purely coincidental and does not imply any
                    form of partnership or official association. Users should be aware that any modifications to this
                    software do not create a legally binding relationship between them and the companies mentioned
                    above.</p>

                <p>The software is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including
                    but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
                    non-infringement. The developers and contributors to this project are not responsible for any
                    issues, damages, or losses that may arise from the use of this software. Users assume all risks
                    associated with the software, including but not limited to data loss, account restrictions, and
                    unexpected behavior resulting from software updates or API changes.</p>

                <p>Leet2Git does not permanently store your GitHub authentication tokens. These tokens are used only in
                    encrypted form for data transfer and are not retained beyond the active session. However, users
                    should be aware that by interacting with third-party platforms such as GitHub, LeetCode, or similar
                    services, their activities may be tracked or monitored according to the privacy policies of those
                    platforms. Users are responsible for reviewing and understanding the privacy policies of all
                    external services they use in conjunction with Leet2Git.</p>

                <p>GitHub enforces API rate limits, and excessive use of this tool may result in temporary or permanent
                    restrictions on a user's GitHub account. The developers of Leet2Git have no control over such
                    restrictions and cannot be held responsible for any account limitations imposed by GitHub. Users are
                    advised to use the tool responsibly and monitor their API usage to avoid exceeding any imposed
                    limits.</p>

                <p>Leet2Git is built upon APIs provided by external platforms. These platforms may change, update, or
                    restrict their APIs at any time, potentially rendering certain features of Leet2Git non-functional.
                    While the development team will make reasonable efforts to update the software as necessary,
                    uninterrupted functionality cannot be guaranteed. Users should be aware that such external changes
                    are beyond the control of the Leet2Git team.</p>

                <p>Security best practices are encouraged for all users. While steps are taken to secure data transfers
                    and protect user information, complete security cannot be guaranteed. Users are advised to enable
                    two-factor authentication on their GitHub accounts, use strong passwords, and avoid using public
                    devices to log in to their GitHub accounts when using Leet2Git.</p>

                <p>These terms and conditions are governed by the laws of India. Any disputes arising from the use of
                    this software shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Bengaluru. By using
                    this software, users acknowledge that they are bound by these legal provisions and accept any

                <p>Users agree to indemnify and hold harmless the developers, contributors, and maintainers of Leet2Git
                    from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, or expenses arising from their use or misuse of the
